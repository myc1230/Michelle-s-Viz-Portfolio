# Hidden Cost of Convenience
Many of you may remember the video of a marine biologist who removed a plastic straw that was stuck in the nostril of a sea turtle. That situation wasn't an isolated case. The convenience and low cost of single use plastic has a heavy hidden cost. In this project, I want to better understand and show the plastic situation through data, from how much is produced to what it is used for.  

##  Project Structure
The overall story structure for my story is: 
Intro: Everyone uses plastic constantly. How much plastic is actually used and produced in the world. 
Conflict/Reality: How is the plastic actually used and what happens to the plastic. The plastic is harming the environment. 
CTA: There's too much plastic being used and wasted. We can help reduce plastic waste by minimizing our plastic consumption and prompt better behaviors. 

As a reader, I want to understand the impact of my actions so that I can minimize the damages those actions cause. 
I can do this by promoting awareness and changing my behavior to miniminize usage of single use plastic. 

The story will be building using Shorthand. The details below will list out my brainstorming process up till the final product. 

## The Data
Data sources list and explaination of how I plan to use the data
Link to the data (either the site or my repos)
[Plastic Pollution Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution)
This is my main data source. It contains various statistic on plastic pollution that I want to examine. I will be using various data from this page to provide the setup and the conflict to my story. 

Below is a few specific data sets used from the Plastic Pollution Data page:

- [Drastic Increase of cumulative plastic production](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#cumulative-production)

- [Plastic Lifecycle in 2015](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#plastic-use-by-sector) 

- [Waste](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#plastic-waste-by-sector)

- [Waste Treatment](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#plastic-disposal-methods) 

[World Population Data](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#population-growth-by-world-region) 
I want to show the population growth during the same period as a way to show perspective to the plastic use increase, as part of my story setup. 

## Wireframes and Story outline

[Wireframe and Storyboard](/plastic waste v1.pdf)

Create sketches that outline the intial thoughths of the final project. 
optional: include in part 1 of project in whatever method makes the most sense to me. It should be clear enough to be understandable by someone with no context. 
Wireframe should mimic aspects of outline; and build on the resounds message you want to make clear through your project. 
Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project. 

Wireframe should include high fidelity, individual draft data vis of the critical elements of my story that I want to share with the reader. 
Wireframe should integrate the data vis through some kid of story board like format. 
Storyboards should be a visual walk through of the primary elements of your outline; typing in the sketches where approprite to illustrate how you intend to lead the 
reader through the experience. 

## User research and Interview
Develope a simple user research protocol that describes what I hope to find during the interview, including the questions and the script. 
After interviews, document findingds that details what I've learned by showing early wireframe/storyboard to at LEAST 3 people. 

Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards and wireframes to address the issues identified.

Describe my interviewees generally. Include any useful direct quotes for each questions adked. Note similiariteis and differences between the observation of the interviewees. 

The prof should be able to clearly follow along my progress. There should be enough details to see how I moved from wireframe/story board to user feedback. 

Hope to understand the strength and clairty of my message

My target audience is the general public, as plastic is part of everyone's life.
