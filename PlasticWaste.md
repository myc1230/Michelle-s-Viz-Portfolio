# Hidden Cost of Convenience
Many of you may remember the video of a marine biologist who removed a plastic straw that was stuck in the nostril of a sea turtle. That situation wasn't an isolated case. The convenience and low cost of single use plastic has a heavy hidden cost. In this project, I want to better understand and show the plastic situation through data, from how much is produced to what it is used for.  

##  Project Structure
The overall story structure for my story is: 

Intro: Everyone uses plastic constantly and the amount of plastic being used constantly increases. 

Conflict/Reality: Plastic is used in all areas of people's life and most of them have a short use life, which results in a lot of trash and waste. 

Resolution/CTA: The problem is bigger than most of us is aware and more than can be solved here. But by raising awareness of how much plastic is being used and wasted, people are more likely to act. We can help reduce plastic waste by minimizing our plastic consumption and prompt better behaviors, and speak up for policies that can make a difference. 

As a reader, I want to understand the impact of my actions so that I can minimize the damages those actions cause. 
I can do this by promoting awareness and changing my behavior to miniminize usage of single use plastic. 

The story will be building using Shorthand. The details below will list out my brainstorming process up till the final product. 

## The Data
[Plastic Pollution Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution)

This is my main data source. It contains various statistic on plastic pollution that I want to examine. I will be using various data from this page to provide the setup and the conflict to my story. 

Below is a few specific data sets used from the Plastic Pollution Data page:

- [Drastic Increase of cumulative plastic production](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#cumulative-production)

- [Plastic Lifecycle in 2015](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#plastic-use-by-sector) 

- [Waste](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#plastic-waste-by-sector)

- [Waste Treatment](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#plastic-disposal-methods) 

[World Population Data](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#population-growth-by-world-region) 
I want to show the population growth during the same period as a way to show perspective to the plastic use increase, as part of my story setup.

## User research and Interview

### User Research Protocol 

From my user research, I hope to understand the strength and clarity of my message. In order to do achieve that I want unskewed feedback from users. 

I plan to start all interviews by given the user some context of the assignment and my ask of them, but no detail on the context of the story. This ensures I don't influence any of their thoughts and impression of the story. I ask them to talk me through their thoughts as soon as they see story, and share any impressions, confusions, or insights as they come up. To ensure I don't disrupt their thought process, I wait till we go through the whole story before I follow up with any questions that wasn't touched upon during their initial feedback.

Below are some of the questions I want answers to: 

1. Did you know this information before reading this website? 

2. Were you surprised by any of the information? 

3. Who do you think is the intended audience of this website? 

4. What do you think is the purpose of this website? 

5. What did you find confusing? What would you change? 

6. What is the first idea/thought that popped into your head when you saw the website? 

7. How do you feel after reading these statistics? 

My target audience is the general public, since the problem of plastics affects everyone. Therefore, I chose a diverse group of individuals to interview. 

As I progressed through the 3 individuals, I did incorporate small changes into my wireframe to try to clarify things for the next user. 

## User Feedback

### User 1
User 1 is a UX designer. 

Her first focus was the big paragraph in the beginning, rather than the title. She felt there was too much dense text. If I wasn't there with her, she said she most likley wouldn't have read every word. (because of this feedback, right after the interview I added some headers and broke up the text a bit to try to improve readability a bit for the next user.

Next up is the two line graphs, she felt the title was confusing and had trouble understanding what the graph was representing. She didn't understand what the two graphs were showing. It took her a while to realize we are making more plastic than there is new people. Which prompted her to ask the question, why are we making more plastic. The felt the following graphs helped answer that question. 

The next section is the bar graph and pie chart. She was confused to what the 60% referred to and thought the graphs were meant to show 100% because they were similar in height. Though she appreciated the simple color difference to differentiate categories, she didn't like the pie chart. Because it was hard to differentiate between the % recycled vs % incinerated. 

A consistant feedback is there is too much to read. There need to be some type of hierachy or highlighting to help break up the dense text blocks. 

After reading the story, she realizes there is a lot of plastic waste and we produce a tons more plastic. She notices we make a lot of plastic and then throw a lot away, but is curious to the trend, as the data only focused on 2015. Is it always this bad or is this a growing trend?
Her first conclusion was "this sucks", she didn't realize how bad the plastic problem was. Her first thought following was curious to what we can do to help the problem. So she appreciated the move the call to action section. Though, because she was a recycler, she didn't think she was part of the problem so she felt less likely to follow through the call to action. 

### User 2 
User 2 is a robotic developer. 

His first impression is there's a lot of reading. However, the graphs were helpful and effective for showing the message. 

When looking at the two trend lines, the difference doesn't appear as dramatic. One should be linear and the other should be exponential, but that isn't easily visible. 

He liked the stacked chart, and like the 1 to 1 comparsion of the groups and seeing their use and waste. It gives the impression we can reduce packing to decrease waste, as that has the highest consumption. He feels some graphic, such as an arrow between the bars to indicate their relationship. 
When looking at the pie chart, he felt the info was incomplete. He wanted to better understand how discard plastic is broken out. 

One aspect he found confusing was the population trend line. As it was the only one not talking about plastic, so it didn't fit in. It took him a while to realize the perspective nature of that graphic. 

He had some knoweldge of these statistic before but was surprised by the 3% of waste in nature. It seemed lower than expected, but he feels if I added more context such as the scope of the total weight, it would be clearer. He was also surprised by the amount of incinerated verse discarded plastic, but know recycled was low. He knew about textile waste but was still surprised about it, with the prevelance of fast fashion. 

He thought the audience is general, uninformed people. As the story shows very introductory and non aggressive information to paint a picture of the plastic problem. The high level nature of the story helps people view this as a problem in a neutral way. 

His overall feeling after reading the story is that small actions are not going to be enough. Asking people to stop drinked bottled water isn't going to make a significant different, it will take greater awareness and policy change to make an impact.  

### User 3
User 3 works in healthcare. 

At first look, he thought the graph axis and title was confusing. He didn't see 2020 on the axis, so wasn't sure what 70 year I was referring to. He couldn't understand the point I was trying to make. It took some reading to understand why I showed population next to plastic production. 

Next up, he looked at the stacked bar chart. He assumed it would be 70 years given the previous graph, so didn't notice it was only for 2015 (which was the latest data point we have). He liked the color used but didn't understand the coorrelation between the two columns. 
When looking at the bar graph, he expected to see percentages as the graph was hard to read. 

He's overall impression of the story is there is a lot of plastic being used and wasted, and much of it ends up being discarded. He feels if we don't change now, we will continue to increase our plastic usage and waste. 

He thought the audience is governement or industry leader given the industry breakdown in the stacked bar char. 

He was surprised by most of the data since he's never seen them before, and was shocked by the size of some of the numbers. 

He like the simple and clear nature of the story, and wouldn't change anything except adding more recent data. 

## Changes to Make
Based on the user feedback, there's a few change I made: 

These changes  got incorporated between user interviews based on user feedback: 
- I added headers and emphasis on text to cut down on the density of the text and highlight what I am trying to show. 
- I added more relative comparison to help user understand the scope of a metric. I improved the language of my plastic growth vs poplution growth comparsion, and added the text comparsion for plastic waste vs cruise ships.  
- I added some text context to the discarded section of the graph to better explain the size of the numbers. . 

Changes to make in the final story: 
- The pie graph didn't clearly show degree of difference for the types of waste management. I will change it to a bar graph to more clearly indicate the high percentage of discarded waste. 
- I will add better perspective graphic comparison to help users better comprehend the amount of waste there is by relating it to number of cruise ships.
- I will improve the plastic life cycle to more clearly show how the plastic used become plastic waste to make my point of the short useful life of most plastic. Right now they just appear to be two separate category rather than a part of a cycle. 
- Break out the text more so it is more easily readable. 
- reword my paragraphs to better explain the message. For example, if I show a number in the paragraph, either explain it better or have it be visible in the corresponding graphic. (ex. 60% of what, 3% of what?)
- add better graph titles and show clearer axis labels. For the year axis especially, I need to indicate the latest year of the data. 
- Work on the comparision of the plastic production and population trend graph. The difference isn't noticable enough to show the point I'm trying to make. I also to make it clear both are global comparsion between 1950 and 2020.   
- add some visual to show the breakdown of Discard plastic waste. 
- add more impactful call to action such as government policies or places for furture education. Or focus on the industries that produces the greatest plastic waste.
