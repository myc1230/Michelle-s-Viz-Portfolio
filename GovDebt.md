## Geographic Location of the Countries 
After looking at the above graphs to see the trend of government debt for the various countries over the year and a deep dive of 2018, I wanted to visualize the location of the countries and see if that impacts the debt amount. Therefore, using the 2018 data year, as that was the most recent complete data for all the countries and to allow comparison against the first graph, I created a heatmap. 

Using the debt ratio as the value, I am now able to see where each country is along with their corresponding debt ratio in 2018. The darker the color the higher their debt ratio for that year. You can hoover over any location to see the name of the country and it's corresponding debt ratio if available. Only 34 countries had data, though the map is sparcely colored. But nonetheless it provides an interesting geographic alternative to the first graph on this page. Not only can we easily see how the debt ratio compara across different countries, we can also see their location relative to each other. Compared to the line graph, it also alters the context of location. An interesting future enhancement would be adding the ability to switch this heat map among the different years. This way, the user can select different years and see how the debt ration changes visually by location, instead of just seeing the number change.
