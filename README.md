# Michelle's DataViz Portfolio
## About Me
Hi there! Thanks for visiting my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU! 
My name is Michelle, and am now a fourth year part time student in the MSIT program, with a focus in business intelligence and data analytics. I took some time off from school but hope to complete my degree by May 2021!
Outside of school, I am a product owner at a healthcare tech company. I hope to continue at that company after graduation. 
## What I hope to learn
From this course, I hope to learn how to take the often immense amount of data we have and turn them into easily consumable visual information. We are in a data rich but information poor world. Even when we do have information, it can often be difficult to comprehend. I also would like to create more visually appealling graphics that properly uses color to convey the point I'm trying to make based on the data available. In the past, I've only used excel and didn't always create the most insightful or pretty graphics.
